## Key Features
### Challenges in Manual Onboarding
- **Time-Consuming**: Manual data entry delays downstream processes.
- **Error-Prone**: Handwritten forms lead to misinterpretations and typos.
- **Scalability Issues**: Inefficient for large organizations with high hiring volumes.

### Automated Onboarding System Components
1. **Document Digitization**:
   - Utilizes OCR (Tesseract) to convert handwritten and printed forms into machine-readable text.
2. **Data Extraction & Processing**:
   - AI models extract candidate details like names and contact information.
   - Automated validation ensures data consistency.
3. **Database Integration**:
   - Structured and normalized database for efficient storage and retrieval.
4. **User Interface**:
   - Intuitive and responsive UI for uploading, searching, and managing records.
5. **Workflow Automation**:
   - End-to-end pipeline: Upload, Process, Validate, Store, and Manage.
